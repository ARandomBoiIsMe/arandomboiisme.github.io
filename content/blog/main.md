tldr: Yay

Took me long enough, lol.

## Layout!
I want:

- A homepage
- A projects page
- A blog page

Nothing else, right now.

## Inspiration!
I've spent the past few months looking at sites whose designs I particularly like:

- [https://benhoyt.com/](https://benhoyt.com/)
- [https://l-m.dev/](https://l-m.dev/)
- [https://vlimki.dev/](https://vlimki.dev/)
- [https://geraldmokereke.xyz/](https://geraldmokereke.xyz/)
- [https://www.teddyoweh.net/](https://www.teddyoweh.net/)
- [https://ludwigabap.bearblog.dev/](https://ludwigabap.bearblog.dev/)
- [https://soulninja.dev/](https://soulninja.dev/)
- [https://jamesl.me/](https://jamesl.me/)
- [https://gurudas.dev/](https://gurudas.dev/)
- etc...

I'm sure you can notice similarities among these various sites. The main one being how straightforward they are.

I'm not a frontend web developer, so my experience with the associated technologies leaves a lot to be desired. For this reason, a simple design is the most attainable for me, and is what I am most drawn to as a result.

## Let's go!
I'm gonna cheat and use a static-site generator, cuz I'm _really_ not in the mood to struggle too much on what's essentially a blog site. "Why not just use [Medium](https://medium.com/)?", I can almost hear you ask. Well, it doesn't support Markdown.

### Which one?
There are [various static-site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/) available for use. So, which one should I use?

After a bit of research, I've decided to use... [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/). It looks easy to use, and it supports Python, so yay.

I'm not gonna document the whole process, lol. Too excited to stop and update this, so I'll just post the final site link so you can visit it when I'm done.

Bye.

Update: You're probably reading this on the site now. Hope you like it. I certainly do.
